# Create Stack using Resource Manager 

## Introduction

In this lab, we will walk you through the necessary steps to help you spin-up different resources, via Resource Manager, that you would need in order to complete this workshop.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes 

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

* Create Stack using Resource Manager

### Prerequisites

  This lab asssumes that you have completed all the previous labs. 

## **Task 1:** Create Stack

After creating your Oracle Cloud account, there is some infrastructure that must be deployed before you can enjoy this tutorial. 

1. Click the button below to begin the deploy of the Data Science stack and custom image:

2. If needed, log into your account. You should then be presented with the **Create Stack** page.

  These next few steps will deploy a stack to your OCI tenancy. This will include a Compute instance and the necessary tools to deploy and run JupyterLab from within your OCI account.

  Under _Stack Information_ (the first screen), check the box _I have reviewed and accept the Oracle Terms of Use_. Once that box is checked, the information for the stack will be populated automatically.

3. Click **Next** at the bottom of the screen. This will take you to the Configure Variables page. On this page you'll need to provide the SSH key we created in the prerequisites if you want SSH access to your Compute instance.

4. On the Review page, be sure _Run Apply_ is checked, and click **Create**.

5. This will take you to the **Job Details** page, and OCI will begin creating the stack and deploying the custom image for the lab. This will take about 11 minutes. When it completes (assuming everything went smoothly), the **Job Details** will show a bright green square with "Succeeded" below it.

6. Once the Create Stack job has succeeded, click the hamburger menu in the upper left, select **Compute** in the sidebar, and click **Instances** in the menu.

7. On the Instances screen, make sure "redbullhol" is selected under _Compartment_. If "redbullhol" isn't in the dropdown menu, you may need to refresh the page for the new compartment to show up.

8. Once the "redbullhol" compartment is selected, you should see a running Instance in the list. The address you'll need to access it is in the Public IP column. Copy the IP address shown.

9. Next, open a new tab in your browser to load up the web UI for JupyterLab. Paste the IP address you just copied with     ```:8888``` added to the end. The URL should look like ``` https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8888 ``` (substituting the public IP we   copied in the previous step). JupyterLab is running on port 8001, so when you navigate to this URL you should see the Juypter login.

  _Note: You should not be on VPN when opening JupyterLab_.

10. Log in with the password ```Redbull1```.

11. You should now see the JupyterLab. Navigate in the sidebar to ```/redbull-analytics-hol/beginners/``` to see the Jupyter notebooks for this lab.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
